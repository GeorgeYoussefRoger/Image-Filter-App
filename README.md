# Image-Filter-App
**FilterApp** is a C++-based command-line application designed for applying various filters to images. Developed as a collaborative team project for a university assignment, this repository includes a single program implementing a collection of image filters. The project inherits from an `Image` class provided by our professor, Dr. Mohamed El-Ramly.

## Features
- Apply 15 distinct filters, including grayscale, merge, brightness, edge detection, blur, frame, rotation, invert, infrared, sunlight, flip, black & white, resize, crop and purple.
- Supports user inputs for filter customization (e.g., brightness percentage, merge options, crop dimensions).
- Validates inputs to ensure valid image files and parameters (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP formats).
- User-friendly menu-driven interface for loading, filtering, and saving images.
